## Overview

a bit of confusion here, i tried many tutorials/looking up on stack etc so help with the hover state of the image block, but i ultimately failed otherwise, everything else was a reasonably easy experience. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size [Yes, seems optimal.]
- See hover states for interactive elements [2/3 hover states done, I tried really hard to make the image state active, it just did not add the color like I kept doing it.]

A few things I tried for the hover on the image: 

```
.hoverstates:hover {
  background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  opacity: .5; 
}
```

As well as changing the top block element and trying to give it an overlay to style that and then create the opacity toward the bottom for the hover-state. :/
