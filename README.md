## Overview

a bit of confusion here, i tried many tutorials/looking up on stack etc so help with the hover state of the image block, but i ultimately failed otherwise, everything else was a reasonably easy experience. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size [Yes, seems optimal.]
- See hover states for interactive elements [2/3 hover states done, I tried really hard to make the image state active, it just did not add the color like I kept doing it.]

A few things I tried for the hover on the image: 

```
.hoverstates:hover {
  background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  opacity: .5; 
}
```

As well as changing the top block element and trying to give it an overlay to style that and then create the opacity toward the bottom for the hover-state. :/

## My process

Markup > then the CSS. 
I tried to be as consice as I could, but i think I did ultimately fail at that, so its something to work on more. Practice. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use `position` a bit more, I had been having issues with understanding it, but using it with the images to create them and make them inline/or as close to being level with the text for the ETH/Day was a good learning experience. 



### Continued development

I need to work on flexbox; I think so many things on this could have come out way nice and more fluid and actually maybe even properly responsive with more flexbox knowledge. so I will be working on that. I need to work on the hover-state too, for the image, I actually have no idea how to do it, and in that vein I think its prudent of me to be better at googling. I likely may have found my answer if I was better at looking things up.
